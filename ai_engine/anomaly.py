"""
Anomaly Detection Module
========================

Detects patterns that warrant user notification/alerts.

Alert Triggers:
    - Sudden score drop > 20 points
    - Zone downgrade (e.g., GREEN → YELLOW)
    - Critical threshold breach (score < 30)
    - Sustained decline (3+ consecutive drops)

Functions:
    - detect_anomaly: Check for alert conditions
    - get_alert_severity: Classify alert urgency
