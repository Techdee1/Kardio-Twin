# CardioTwin AI — Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0 | **Date:** February 21, 2026 | **Status:** FINAL — Ready for 24-Hour Sprint

---

## 1. Mission & Theme Alignment

**Mission:** Build a working prototype in 24 hours that demonstrates real-time cardiometabolic risk scoring from live sensor data, delivered through a web dashboard and WhatsApp notifications.

**Hackathon Theme:** *"From Data to Prevention: AI as Your Health Partner"*

| Theme Word | Our Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Data** | Live biometric data from MAX30102 + NTC sensors |
| **Prevention** | Predictive risk scoring + what-if projections |
| **AI** | Adaptive risk engine + pattern detection |
| **Health Partner** | Real-time nudges via WhatsApp + dashboard |

---

## 2. Problem Statement

- **~11% of all deaths** in Nigeria are attributed to CVDs (WHO)
- **70% of cardiovascular deaths** occur in people who were **never screened**
- Nigeria has **~4 physicians per 10,000 people** — preventive cardiology is nearly non-existent
- No existing system makes the connection between **"what I just did"** and **"what my heart just felt"** immediate, tangible, and personal

> **Our Hypothesis:** If we give people a real-time, personalized score that visibly reacts to their physiological state, they will make better health decisions because consequences become immediate — not abstract.

---

## 3. Solution Overview

**CardioTwin AI** is a station-based health screening system with three layers:

1. **Sense** — Captures HR, HRV, SpO₂, and skin temperature from a finger-placed sensor station
2. **Score** — AI risk engine processes raw biometrics into a **CardioTwin Score (0–100)**
3. **Nudge** — Delivers alerts via web dashboard, WhatsApp, and physical vibration buzz

### Scope: IN ✅
- Working hardware station with finger sensor
- Real-time data streaming to Azure cloud
- CardioTwin Score algorithm (0–100, 4 zones)
- Live web dashboard with graphs and score gauge
- WhatsApp alert integration via Twilio
- What-if risk projection (static/pre-calculated)
- Before/after demo capability
- Vibration motor alert on station

### Scope: OUT ❌
- Wearable device (pitched as v2 vision only)
- Facial expression analysis
- Mobile native app (web PWA only)
- User authentication / multi-user accounts
- Deep learning models
- Medical-grade diagnostic claims

## 5. The CardioTwin Score

The single most important feature — transforms complex multi-dimensional biometric data into one number anyone can understand.

### Score Zones

| Zone | Range | Label | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🟢 Green | 80–100 | Thriving | No alert |
| 🟡 Yellow | 55–79 | Mild Strain | WhatsApp nudge |
| 🟠 Orange | 30–54 | Elevated Risk | WhatsApp + vibration buzz |
| 🔴 Red | 0–29 | Critical Strain | WhatsApp + vibration + urgent message |

### Scoring Weights

| Component | Weight | Why |
|---|---|---|
| HRV (RMSSD) | **40%** | Strongest non-invasive predictor of cardiac autonomic health |
| Heart Rate | **25%** | Direct indicator of cardiovascular load |
| SpO₂ | **20%** | Blood oxygenation — safety check for respiratory distress |
| Skin Temperature | **15%** | Correlates with stress response and inflammation |

### How It Works
1. **Baseline Calibration (first 30s):** Records resting HR, HRV, SpO₂, and temperature as personal reference
2. **Real-Time Scoring (every 2s):** Compares incoming data against baseline, calculates weighted composite
3. **Pattern Detection (over sessions):** Identifies personal risk patterns over time

---

## 6. Hardware Specification

### Station Design (Not a wearable — by design)

The MAX30102 requires firm, stable skin contact and minimal motion for accurate PPG readings. A station-based finger sensor gives **clinical-grade accuracy** every time, eliminates motion artifact risk, and avoids demo failures.

> During the pitch, frame the wearable as the v2 vision: *"The algorithm is built. The form factor evolves."*

### Components

| Component | Purpose | Est. Cost |
|---|---|---|
| ESP32-WROOM-32 | Microcontroller + WiFi | ~₦3,500 |
| MAX30102 | Heart Rate, HRV, SpO₂ | ~₦2,000 |
| 10kΩ NTC Thermistor | Skin Temperature | ~₦300 |
| 10kΩ Resistor | Voltage divider for NTC | ~₦50 |
| Mini Vibration Motor (3V) | Tactile alert | ~₦500 |
| 2N2222 NPN Transistor + 1kΩ Resistor | Motor driver | ~₦100 |
| Breadboard + Jumper Wires | Assembly | ~₦800 |
| Micro-USB Cable | Power + programming | ~₦500 |
| **TOTAL** | | **~₦7,750 (~$10)** |

### Wiring Reference

```
ESP32 PIN           →    COMPONENT
──────────────────────────────────────────
3.3V                →    MAX30102 VIN

GPIO 21 (SDA)       →    MAX30102 SDA
GPIO 22 (SCL)       →    MAX30102 SCL
3.3V                →    10kΩ Resistor ──┐
GPIO 34 (ADC)       →    Junction ───────┤
GND                 →    NTC Thermistor ─┘
GPIO 25             →    1kΩ → 2N2222 Base
                         Collector → Motor → 3.3V
                         Emitter → GND
```

### Station Enclosure

Simple cardboard/foam box with a hole for the MAX30102 sensor on top. Labeled "Place Finger Here ☝️". Sensor MUST be secured firmly (hot glue) to prevent wobble during demo.

## 11. Demo Script (3 Minutes)

### Act 1 — The Hook (30s)
*"Every 33 seconds, someone dies of cardiovascular disease. In Nigeria, 7 out of 10 of those people were never screened. What if your body could warn you — not your doctor, not a hospital — but your body, in real time, before it's too late?"*

### Act 2 — Live Demo (90s)
1. Volunteer places finger on CardioTwin Station
2. Dashboard shows data streaming live → Score: **🟢 86 — Thriving**
3. Volunteer does 30s of burpees (presenter narrates the AI engine)
4. Volunteer returns, places finger again
5. Score drops live: **🟠 41 — Elevated Risk**
6. Vibration motor buzzes on station
7. WhatsApp message arrives on volunteer's phone
8. Show What-If: *"If this pattern continues 90 days → risk category shifts"*

### Act 3 — The Vision (45s)
*"Today: one person, one station, one score. Tomorrow: community health workers across Nigeria, each with a ₦8,000 CardioTwin device, screening entire villages in hours. Population-level dashboards helping state health ministries allocate resources where risk is highest."*

### Act 4 — The Close (15s)
*"From data, to prevention, to partnership. This is CardioTwin AI — your heart's early warning system."*

### 🛡️ BACKUP PLAN
Pre-record a full demo video the night before. If hardware fails, play the video. **Never demo without a backup.**

---

## 12. Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| WiFi fails at venue | High | Critical | Test venue WiFi early. Backup: mobile hotspot. Emergency: pre-recorded video |
| MAX30102 gives erratic readings | Medium | High | Station-based (not wearable) = stable contact. Calibrate before demo. Have backup recorded data |
| Azure deployment issues | Medium | High | Deploy by Hour 8. Test early. Fallback: run locally on laptop |
| Twilio WhatsApp fails | Medium | Medium | Pre-join Twilio sandbox. Test with real number. Fallback: show SMS or mock notification |
| Team member burns out | High | High | Mandatory 2-hour rest at Hour 12-14. No hero coding |
| Integration breaks at Hour 20 | Medium | Critical | Integrate early (Hour 8 first test). API contracts agreed at Hour 0 |
| Judges question "Digital Twin" claim | High | High | We DON'T call it a digital twin. It's an "Adaptive Risk Model" — honest and defensible |

## 13. Prepared Judge Q&A

**Q: "Is this medically accurate?"**
> "CardioTwin is a wellness screening tool, not a medical device. Our MAX30102 sensor provides research-grade PPG data, and our scoring algorithm is based on published clinical correlations between HRV and cardiovascular risk. We clearly disclaim this in the UI."

**Q: "Why not a wearable?"**
> "Clinical-grade PPG requires stable skin contact. Even Apple Watch uses motion compensation algorithms that took years to develop. Our station gives accurate data every time. The wearable is our v2 — the intelligence is built today."

**Q: "How is this different from a Fitbit?"**
> "Fitbit gives you data. We give you a decision. Our CardioTwin Score collapses complex biometrics into one actionable number, and our nudge system delivers guidance through WhatsApp — where 93 million Nigerians already live. No app download required."

**Q: "Can this scale?"**
> "The hardware costs ₦8,000. The backend runs on Azure free tier. Community health workers could screen a village of 500 in a single day. The data aggregates into population-level risk heatmaps for state health ministries."
